TP3 Screencast Instructions and Upload Guide

Overview
- The TP3 phase requires three screencasts:
  1) Code walkthrough: explain how the new code works, implementation details, and JUnit test validation.
  2) Alignment walkthrough: show how the product vision and user stories map to architecture, design (UML), and tests.
  3) Standup recordings: short clips (2-5 minutes each) that show team collaboration and handling of unplanned issues.

Recording specs (recommended)
- Format: MP4 or WebM
- Resolution: 1080p (1920x1080) preferred
- Audio: Use a headset mic for clarity
- Naming: `TP3_<team>_screencast_<1|2|3>_v1.mp4`

What to include in each screencast
1) Code walkthrough
- Short introduction (30s)
- Show the repository structure and files changed for TP3
- Walk through the key code files and test classes used in this phase
- Run the JUnit tests live and show results
- Conclude with summary (30s)

2) Vision->Design->Tests alignment
- Show the selected user stories and explain why they were chosen
- Show UML diagrams (Astah exported PNGs) and explain mapping to code
- Explain how each test validates pieces of the design

3) Standup recordings
- Upload the recorded audio/video of at least three standup meetings (2-5 minutes each) capturing unplanned issues and decisions

Uploading to GitHub
- Place screencasts in `HW3/screencasts/`. If files are large, use Git LFS or provide a download link that grader can use. Confirm grader can download files.
- Add a small text file next to each screencast with a timestamp and description of the clip.

Permissions
- Add the grader as a collaborator with read access OR provide a permissioned team link. Verify access with the grader before final submission.

Checklist before submission
