## Running the Application- Students can search for questions by ID

- Searching allows students to find existing solutions and avoid duplicate questions.

1. Navigate to the `Application/` directory

2. Use the following command in PowerShell:### 3. Suggesting Clarifications



```powershell- Students can submit clarification requests on questions or answers.

java --module-path .\javafx-sdk\javafx-sdk-24.0.2\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp ".\bin;.\lib\h2-2.2.224.jar" application.StartCSE360

```### 4. Marking an Answer as Accepted



## Requirements- Students can mark an answer as Accepted to show that it resolved the original question.

- Accepted answers are highlighted so that future users can quickly find solutions.

- Java 24

- JavaFX 24.0.2 (included in project)### 5. Input Validation & Error Handling

- H2 Database (included in project)
