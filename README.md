## Overview

In Team Project Phase 2 we will make aÂ **Student Q&A System.**
This system allows students to:

- Ask questions and provide answers.
- Search for relevant questions and answers.

In this project we will be building on **Individual Homework 2 (HW2)** and Team Project Phase 1 which uses functionality, including:

- Search functionality for finding relevant questions and answers.
- The ability to suggest clarifications for better understanding.
- A feature to mark an answer as the accepted solution.
- Enhanced CRUD operations with validation.
- Automated and manual testing to ensure system reliability.
